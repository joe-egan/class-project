<h2> The app will reflect a game of sticks</h2>
<p1>sticks is a game in which the total number of sticks <br>
each player has cannot be exactly equal to five, <br>
and if more than 5 are a final result, the difference between <br>
the total and 5 is the resulting amount. The game ends when a player <br>
loses both bundles of 5 sticks</p1>
